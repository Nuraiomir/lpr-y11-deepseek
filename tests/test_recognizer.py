"""
Regression test for app/lpr/recognizer.py. No GPU and no models needed.

Feeds LPRRecognizer the OCR readings that the GPU pipeline produced on
videos/20260908_150904.mp4 and checks that it makes the same decisions as
that run: in particular that the short-lived square plate 979CBB02 is
confirmed at 2.4 s and the switch to 221ZVZ05 happens at 3.7 s.

The readings are recorded pipeline output, not verified ground truth. This
test proves the voting and switching logic, not OCR accuracy.

The recordings come from the laboratory repository, where the videos and the
offline pipeline live. They are kept here as literals on purpose: a test that
needed those videos could not run in CI.

Run:
