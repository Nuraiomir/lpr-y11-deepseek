"""
A stand-in for the OCRM lookup, so the whole scenario can be shown end to end.

This is NOT the bank's OCRM. It is a JSON file with invented vehicles, loaded
at start, and it exists because the demo has to show what happens after a plate
is confirmed: the card of the vehicle, or a plain statement that this plate is
not in the database. Every record in it is made up. No real borrower, credit or
vehicle is described here, and nothing is ever sent outside this process.

The distinction the scenario turns on is kept here as well: a plate that is not
found is a normal answer, not an error and not a recognition failure. So the
lookup answers 200 with found=false rather than 404, and the caller is expected
to say so in those words.
